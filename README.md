Hello everyone!
I am a teenager boy who made a website with the assistance of AI.
If you have checked the website, there will be a bunch of bugs which are mostly caused by the api.
I am currently in the process of fixing the bugs but it might take a while to fix it.
The manual barcode input parcially works with a specific barcode format but the ingredients are going to be written in a different language.
The camera scanning doesn't work so I am going to try to fix that after the manual barcode input problem.
